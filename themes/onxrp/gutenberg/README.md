## Install Packages

`yarn install` (Only once or after adding any package to package.json file)

## Running builds

Run `yarn block-build` to build all production assets. Run `yarn block-start` for a development build of assets, which also watches files for changes and automatically recompiles.

## Hot Reloading

Still to come. The closest you can get now is running `yarn block-start`, which watches for changes, and reloading the page.

## Running Tests

Run `yarn test` to run Jest tests against JavaScript files. Run `yarn test:watch` to keep the test runner open and watching for changes.

Run `yarn lint` to run ESLint against all JavaScript files. Linting will also happen when running development or production builds.

Run `phpcs` to run PHP CodeSniffer tests against PHP files.
